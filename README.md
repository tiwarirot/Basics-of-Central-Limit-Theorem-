# Basics-of-Central-Limit-Theorem-
The central limit theorem states that if you have a population with mean μ and standard deviation σ and take sufficiently large random samples from the population with replacement , then the distribution of the sample means will be approximately normally distributed.

This is just a basic implementation of Central Limit Theorem in python with some examples.
